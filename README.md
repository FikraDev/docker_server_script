# docker_server_script

This is a bash script to be used in provisioning a linux server for working with containers.

It updates the server and installs the all the tools to begin working with docker including directories along with the docker-compose files.

As i learn more about bash i will add more scripts to automate the tasks that i would have to do on a regular basis.
